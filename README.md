# Euphoric-Bliss-Smart-Contract
Our founder has built this product with the intentions of becoming a true trailblazer in the mass migration of cryptocurrency to the world. We have built our token to have a similar function to a stock. In the aspect of, connecting your cryptocurrency to a physical real life product will provide sustainability. A token needs something to live off of besides hype, fomo, & marketing. In order for mass migration to ever take place in crypto, it needs to be attached to a real life business and products. This will provide sustainability and help hold projects more accountable. Our token tax will be reduced when our product line goes live. This will take place within the first 90 after launch. We are doing this because our products will have the state & federal sales included in their price. To prevent our holders/customers from being double taxed, our token tax will be reduced to a 5% tax for both the buy & sell tax with it all going to our LP. Also a portion of every sale that our company makes will go into our LP. We expect this to be between $1-$3 per item that we sell throughout our corporation lifetime.
